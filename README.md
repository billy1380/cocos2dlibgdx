COCOS2D-LIBGDX
==============

What?
-----

From Wikipedia:
- Cocos2d is an open source software framework. It can be used to build games, apps and other cross platform GUI based interactive programs. 
- libGDX is a game-development application framework written in the Java programming language with some C and C++ components for performance dependent code. It is cross-platform, supporting Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, and web browsers with WebGL support.

Cocos2d-libGdx is a framework for building 2D games, demos and other graphical/interactive applications. It is built on top of libGdx to use Java as the main programming language, to support multi platforms. It is based on the Cocos2d design: uses the same API.


Why?
----

LibGdx is an excellent framework, however it is a low level framework.
Cocos2d is an excellent framework too, however programmers must use C/C++ (or Objective C) to develop.

The new framework Cocos2D-LibGdx has some combined advantages:
(from libGdx)
- developers can work with Java which has a lot of good and high productivity tools such as eclipse
- Can work with any version of OpenGL (depend only on which version of LibGdx)
- Write one, run on many platforms
- Still allow developers write low level code if he wants

 
(from Cocos2D)
- High level framework, faster and less errors to develop


Demo
----

To run the demo on destop:
- Download or pull all
- Import them into eclipse as normal Java projects
- Right click on project cclgdxdemos-desktop and select Run as/Java Application
